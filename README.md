# Personal-Testing-Grounds
 A safe space where I an test out new stuff and gain an understanding of concepts while trying them out myself.
 
 This page will be updated with the projects that I experiment with and how to use/change them.


# Current Projects - AUG 1 2020

## LifeCalendar
The Life Calendar is essentially a calendar to view how much time you have left to live by coloring in the months you already lived in red. Lurid? Possibly, but very movitivating.

## Custom Editors
Not a single project, but an ongoing one. I want to be able to utilise every custom editor aspect at some point.

## Key Remapper 
It is notoriously hard to get key remapping to work in Unity as very little info is available about it. I developed a system that does it flawlessly and I tried making it as performance-friendly as possible.

## School Subjects (WIP)
This is a tool that allows you to add your class, the hour, day, etc. to a notification list, which will send notifications when you have the class. I created this project to test and expand on my data structure skillset.

## Tower Defense (WIP)
A small and simplistic tower defense game to work on things like pathfinding, grid placement, etc. Currently work in progress.

## Procedural Generation (WIP)
I have not started this yet.
